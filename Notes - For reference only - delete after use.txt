First pass — fill these with placeholder but binding rules:

handbook/tech-stack.md → Languages, frameworks, versions, DB choice.

handbook/ui-ux-style-guide.md → Colors, typography, component rules.

handbook/api-conventions.md → Naming, versioning, error envelope, pagination.

handbook/security-baseline.md → OWASP target, auth type, headers, secrets policy.

handbook/guards/cursor_system_prompt.md → Copy in the guardrails we discussed.

💡 These 5 files will immediately reduce Cursor’s tendency to “get creative.”


------------------

Seed the Global Contracts
Before any feature work, give Cursor a fixed target for APIs and global references:

openapi/leave_mgmt.yaml → Add just one endpoint (e.g., POST /leave-requests) to prove schema-first flow.

registries/screens.csv → Add first screen entry (SCR-201 Apply Leave).

registries/workflows.csv → Add first workflow entry (WF-041 Leave Application).

catalogs/ui_patterns.md → List 2–3 reusable patterns (FormTwoColumn, SummaryCard, TableList).

-----------------

Build the First Feature Folder
Start with features/leave-application/:

Fill README.md with feature overview + links to specs.

Create 1 screen spec in screens/ (using IDs from registries).

Create 1 workflow spec in workflows/ (also from registries).

Add any BR/VAL that are unique to this feature in local br/ and validations/.

----------------

Run the First Cursor Loop
Use the three-prompt loop we discussed:

Update OpenAPI for the API.

Implement API handler + tests.

Build UI screen calling that API.

---------------
feature folder
menus and page layout (add these layout rules to the ui-ux-style-guide.md and update the never_touch_list.md)
Role-driven menus, Role-driven menus

Work on
Feature folder
Add role-driven menu rules + context-switch pattern to ui-ux-style-guide.md
Add templates/partials/sidebar.html and templates/partials/topbar.html as never-touch items in never_touch_list.md so Cursor always extends them.
Add the DB-based role model into the authentication-authz.md
Update ui-ux-style-guide.md navigation section to say menu is generated from DB role mapping via helper function.

Before development:
Create virtual environment
Install dependencies
Set-up git repo
set-up ci-cd workflow
set-up docker workflow
